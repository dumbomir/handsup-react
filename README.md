[Building HandsUp: an OS real-time Q&A App using GraphQL and React](https://medium.com/@gerard.sans/building-handsup-an-os-real-time-voting-app-using-graphql-and-react-b2b7dcd0e136)

## HandsUp ðŸ™Œ
Make your events more interactive allowing attendees to participate by adding questions and voting using their phone or laptop.

Organisers and speakers can use it to answer questions and run Q&A or panels sessions.

## Technology stack

This application integrates the following technologies:
- [Auth0](http://auth0.com) to authenticate users using their social profiles (Google, Twitter)
- [Apollo Client](http://dev.apollodata.com) to communicate with GraphQL Server
- [graphcool](http://graph.cool) providing the GraphQL Server

## Usage

Log in using your social account to be able to add new questions. In order to vote click on the heart button besides each question.

## Development

If you have any questions feel free to ping me on [@gerardsans](http://twitter.com/gerardsans).

> Note: requires a node version >=6.x

## Getting Started

In order to run this project you need to create the data model (schema) below using [graphcool](http://graph.cool) console online and setup Auth0. 

### graphcool - HandsUp Schema

This is the schema used

```graphql
type Question @model {
  id: ID! @isUnique
  body: String!
  votes: [Vote!]! @relation(name: "VoteOnQuestion")
  user: User @relation(name: "UserOnQuestion")
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type Vote @model {
  id: ID! @isUnique
  question: Question @relation(name: "VoteOnQuestion")
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type User @model {
  auth0UserId: String
  id: ID! @isUnique
  name: String
  username: String
  pictureUrl: String
  questions: [Question!]! @relation(name: "UserOnQuestion")
  role: USER_ROLE
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

enum USER_ROLE {
  Admin
  Organiser
  Moderator
  User
}
```

You can read the following blog as reference for an example as how you would create a schema from scratch
